Position: Senior Laravel + Vue Developer
Overview
Build a Dynamic Commission Engine that allows administrators to create and manage commission formulas without changing application code.
The solution should demonstrate backend architecture, frontend design, problem-solving ability, and scalability considerations.
Business Scenario
Energy brokers receive commission based on customer contracts.
Commission calculations must be configurable by administrators and support multiple versions over time.
Example:
Version 1
Commission = Annual Usage × 0.05
Version 2
Commission = (Annual Usage × 0.05) + (Contract Length × 100)
The system should support creating, testing, and activating new commission formulas.
Functional Requirements
1. Formula Builder
Create a UI that allows administrators to create commission formulas.
Supported variables:
•	Annual Usage
•	Contract Value
•	Contract Length
•	Risk Score
Example formula:
(AnnualUsage * 0.05) + (ContractLength * 100)
Requirements:
•	Save formulas in the database
•	Validate formulas before saving
•	Support multiple versions
•	Only one version can be active at a time
2. Commission Calculation
Given a contract, calculate the commission using the active formula.
Display:
•	Formula Version
•	Input Values
•	Calculation Result
Store calculation history for future reference.
3. Formula Impact Analysis
Before activating a new formula, provide a simulation mode.
The simulation should show:
•	Number of affected contracts
•	Current total commission
•	New total commission
•	Difference between the two
The simulation must not modify existing commission records.
4. Dependency Validation
Support calculated variables.
Example:
BaseCommission = AnnualUsage * 0.05
BonusCommission = BaseCommission * 0.10
FinalCommission = BaseCommission + BonusCommission
Requirements:
•	Detect circular dependencies
•	Prevent invalid formulas
•	Calculate in the correct sequence
5. Audit Trail
Every commission calculation should be traceable.
Display:
•	Formula Version
•	Calculation Date
•	Input Values
•	Calculation Steps
•	Final Result
Technical Requirements
Backend
•	Laravel
•	REST API
•	Queue Jobs where appropriate
•	Unit Tests
Frontend
•	Vue 
Database
•	MySQL
Deliverables
•	Source Code
•	README
•	Database Schema
•	API Documentation
•	Test Cases
•	Architecture Notes
The focus is on maintainable architecture and clean implementation rather than UI styling.
